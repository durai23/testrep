Hi Jan,

In order to make lmod work we need to configure some files (It doesn't work at the moment - you can check by running "module avail" or "module list" commands - It will say "module: command not found")

Kindly apply the following operations to make it work -

For the bash shell -

cp /usr/share/lmod/6.6/init/bash /etc/profile.d/

For the tcsh shell -

cp /usr/share/lmod/6.6/init/tcsh /etc/csh/login.d/

cp /usr/share/lmod/6.6/init/cshrc /etc/csh/login.d/

Then you can check by running "module avail" or "module list" commands to see if it works.

Also you mentioned that Luisa Schafer could not login after lmod installation. Could you kindly let me know if users are experiencing login issues on imecas08 after configuring lmod as above. If no issues are found we can then repeat these steps on otehr imecas.

Best,

Durai 

Hi Jan,

Thanks for letting me know. I've killed the command. I was just making sure all occurences of "/usr/share/modules/init/*sh"are found and removed.

Hi Jan,

Removing this file should get rid of the error message -

/etc/csh/login.d/modules

It is the system wide initializing script of environment-modules for tcsh.

Let me know if you still get any errors or login problems.
