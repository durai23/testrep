When importing/opening please keep the following in mind:
- character for column seperation is Tab, nothing else (common defaults include , or ;)
- no character defines or splits textfields (common default ")
- character set is Unicode / UTF-8, no latin-1 or ISO-8859-1
- numbers are recorded in English notation, so the importing language should be English as well.
- the content of the columns has to be interpreted as text, not function or control symbol

mergedlist.csv contains all columns joined consecutively, depending on the amount of data this can cause problems with Excel or similar software.

Explanations for column names and encodings can be found in the file data_fields.csv or at http://loris.ime.kfa-juelich.de/neurodb/NDB_1000G_V01_BETA/htdocs/main.php?test_name=data_fields (Login: DNA ; Password: G@5tzugang). The Interface is mostly English, unfortunately most explanations are only available in German (yet).
