DGEMM Cuda Exercise - Simple CPU implementation
-----------------------------------------------

files: dgemm_cpu_simple.cu

Take a look at the DGEMM CPU implementation. Activate the Cuda timing
by uncommenting the corresponding lines (marked with "TODO"). Compile
and run the program using 

--> make dgemm_cpu_simple
--> ./dgemm_cpu_simple 

Hint: Do not start the program on the login node, otherwise the timing
      will fail.
