DGEMM Cuda Exercise - Tiled Matrix Multiplication
--------------------------------------------------

files: dgemm_tiled.cu

Implement DGEMM with Cuda doing a tiled matrix multiplication using
cuBlas library. Test your program with different matrix (n) and tile
sizes (m), where n has to be divisible by m. 


--> make dgemm_tiled
--> ./dgemm_tiled
