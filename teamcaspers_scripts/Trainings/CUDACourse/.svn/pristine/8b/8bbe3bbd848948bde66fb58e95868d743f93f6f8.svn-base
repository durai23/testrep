Instructions
============

In this exercise, we'll scale a vector (array) of single precision numbers by a scalar. You'll learn 
how to allocate memory on the GPU and transfer data to and from the GPU.

Data transfer with unified memory
---------------------------------

Take a look at the file ``scale_vector_um.cu``. It contains a number of todos. 

For this exercise, you'll use ``cudaMallocManaged`` to allocate memory:

cudaMallocManaged(T** devPtr, size_t size, unsigned int flags)

Like most CUDA functions, ``cudaMallocManaged`` returns ``cudaError_t``.

See the source for more todos. Use ``nvcc -o scale_vector_um scale_vector_um.cu`` to compile the 
code and then run it.
