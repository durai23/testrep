DGEMM Cuda Exercise - Simple GPU implementation
-----------------------------------------------

files: dgemm_gpu_simple_uvm.cu, dgemm_gpu_simple.cu

a) Implement DGEMM with cuda. Compile and run the program:

   --> make dgemm_gpu_simple_uvm
   --> CUDA_MANAGED_FORCE_DEVICE_ALLOC=1 ./dgemm_gpu_simple_uvm

   Run your program with different matrix sizes (can be specified as
   command line parameter) and take a look at the resulting performance.

b) Replace the register variable ``Cvalue`` with direct access to the
   global memoray array (``c[...]``). Do not forget to initialize
   c[..]. How does this change affect the execution time ? 

c) Implement DGEMM with cuda using explicit data transfers. Compile
   and run the program: 

   --> make dgemm_gpu_simple
   --> ./dgemm_gpu_simple 

   Run your program with different matrix sizes (can be specified as
   command line parameter) and take a look at the resulting
   performance. Compare the results with the UVM version of your
   program (with and without CUDA_MANAGED_FORCE_DEVICE_ALLOC
   parameter set)
