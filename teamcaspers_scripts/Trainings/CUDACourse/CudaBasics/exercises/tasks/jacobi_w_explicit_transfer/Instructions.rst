Jacobi with explicit memory allocation and transfers
====================================================
In this exercise, we take the Jacobi example that uses unified memory and change it to use separate
memory allocation on host and device and explicit transfers. The corresponding parts of the code are
marked with todos. You can compile the code with ``make``.

Once you changed the program, generate a profile and examine it with nvvp. How does it compare to
the profile for the unified memory version.
