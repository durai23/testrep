DGEMM Cuda Exercise - Shared memory implementation
--------------------------------------------------

files: dgemm_gpu_shared_uvm.cu, dgemm_gpu_shared.cu

Implement DGEMM with Cuda using shared memory. Compare the performance
results with your simple Cuda implementation for different matrix sizes.

--> make dgemm_gpu_shared_uvm
--> CUDA_MANAGED_FORCE_DEVICE_ALLOC=1 ./dgemm_gpu_shared_uvm

and compare the performance with the previous runs.

... if there is time left:

Include explicit data transfers (using cudaMemcpy) instead of using
UVM and compare the performance numbers with your UVM implementation
