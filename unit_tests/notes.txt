An integration test aims to test the behavior of a component or the integration between a set of components

The percentage of code which is tested by unit tests is typically called test coverage.

A unit test targets a small unit of code, e.g., a method or a class. External dependencies should be removed from unit tests, e.g., by replacing the dependency with a test implementation or a (mock) object created by a test framework.

In any case you should write software tests for the critical and complex parts of your application. If you introduce new features a solid test suite also protects you against regression in existing code.
