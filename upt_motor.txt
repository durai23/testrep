why upts are less when doing thigns like cleaning kitchen top

coordinated and modulated movement of hands with a little bit of simple planning

whle upts are high during future planning like travel - optimizing multiple challenge s goals etc


upts also high when runnning to catch bus, gym workout, treadmill etc


model1
constant upt generation - constant monitoring - activity leads to allocaiton of monitorning neurons to activity hence upt increases

model2
no constant upt generation - what is the source of upt then - if stimuli to gfive senses - then sthere should be no upt in perfect darkness - which is not the case

why is there upt in perfect darkness - because brain constantly generating thoughts and no idle

also upts low during stimulation - liveleak - and lesser jav


upts from registering human bots or on vid - sexual etc are exclusive to comprehension and run in interlaced manner ( as brain is serial) - eg human explaining a chart (comprehension beign the chart)
